# Stewie410's dwmblocks

This is my personal build of dwmblocks.

## Patches

* [dwmblocks-statuscmd](https://gist.github.com/toniz4/41d168719e22bf7bc4ecff09d424b7d2)

## TODO

* Get click events working for each module (where applicable)
* Maybe add some color?

## Assumptions

* The `dwm` scripts from my dotfiles are available in your path

## DWMBLOCKS README

```txt
# dwmblocks

Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

# modifying blocks

The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
```
